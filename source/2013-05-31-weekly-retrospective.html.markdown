It seems like the weeks are going by faster and faster! Working on my own this week has been awesome actually. It is just amazing to see what you can do on your own. 

I have been able to do more on my own than I thought that I could but it is definitely going slower than I expected. I ran into an issue with authentication with Foursquare that I battled with for an entire day and when you have only 9 days that is a long time.  I did ask for help and that is how the problem was eventually solved. I am glad I am past it and I feel the other steps after authentication will be easier. I am going to have to really push through the weekend to get this project done by Thursday but I know I can get it out on time. I have yet to use three hours of time I have from other students as well as hours promised by one of the other mentors.

Since we only have seven weeks left in the program, my main focus will be solidifying the foundation that has already been laid for me. I need to get everything down before we finish and I am trying to stay on top of my work and reading in order to do so. I have many resources to draw from like the teaching staff, other students, my mentor, personal friends and some of the connections I have made along the way which makes that process a bit easier.


When I came into the program I definitely had my beliefs about what success would look like coming out of the program. One thing I have relaized is I do have a knack for design and I really wouldn't mind working as a designer or a developer. I think both fields are equally challenging. It is interesting how your strengths and weaknesses become magnified in a situation like this and I think it has helped me learn a lot about myself and my learning process. 

The most important thing I have gained from this experience thus far is people will only believe in you if you believe in yourself. It sounds trite and cheesy but it is completely true. Also, it is best to try and make as many connections as possible because people are more than willing to show you what they know and how they work if you ask. Finally, I think that you can't be intimidated by anyone's name or brand because you may be passing up on an opportunity that could be influential in your career. To assume that every company wants to hire the same five people in the class is a mistake- one because it is physically impossible for 5 people to be hired full time by 15 different companies and two because someone may have all the skills in the world but those skills may not be the only thing a company is looking for. 

I can see the pressure building about jobs and I am starting to feel it myself but I think it will work out just fine for everyone as long as we put in the effort necessary and by what I have seen so far I don't think anyone here is lacking in effort.
