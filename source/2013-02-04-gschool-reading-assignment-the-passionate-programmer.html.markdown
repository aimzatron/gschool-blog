> A tip that rung true to me in The Passionate Programmer was the 'Don't Panic' tip. I think 
>when you get really frustrated it makes it difficult to be productive. When I worked in tech 
>support it was easy to let your emotions get outta control which meant your head was all over   >the place.
>
> Over the past week or so, I have learned that programming can be quite tedious and if you 
>allow yourself to be overcome by fear that you will make a mistake, then you will be much more 
>likely to do so.
>
>Another great tip was 'Don't put all of your eggs in someone else's basket'. It is easy to just 
>revert to becoming an expert at one specific technology but someday someone is going to ask you 
>to do something else or perhaps worse, said technology will fade out entirely. I have gone into >careers blindly a few times thinking I was talented enough to compete with the other employees
>but had a rude awakening that I needed to learn many things. 
>
>'Learn how to fall' was another tip that resonated with me. I think the technological world is 
>full of 'one-up-ers'. Avoiding that game will keep your life at work much more healthy. It is 
>hard to show up to work and know that you will be laughed at for asking a question. Now I am 
>in this environment where questions are not only welcome but appreciated. I want to take this 
>opportunity to learn as much as I can and not let me pride get in the way. 
>
>The only tip that I felt was hard for me to relate to was 'Love It or Leave It'. While I agree 
>that you should have fun at work, I think that sometimes the hard jobs are the ones that you 
>learn the most from. That is not to say that I think that people should just stay at jobs that 
>they hate but I do think it is important to finish what you started and learn from each life 
>experience you have, good or bad.
