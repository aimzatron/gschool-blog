Last week we started learning more and more Rails which has been a really interesting experience. It is really nice to have good foundation in Ruby especially while working on Store Engine. 

Store Engine has been a great project so far. I have learned a lot about e-commerce sites and timing it with reading Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" was a great plan on the instructors part. I am glad to learn things web designers and developers should have known before they made a site before I actually do professional work because it gives me a strong foundation to work with. 

Working wit my group on the project has been an cool experience. I feel like the team I am on really tries to focus on getting things done correctly and makes sure that everyone understands what is going on. That patience is necessary to learn anything well and I think that it will pay off with as far as our understanding of rails goes. 

There is a lot more work to do on Store Engine and I am enjoying "Don't Make Me Think" so it is safe to say that I am looking forward to this week!
