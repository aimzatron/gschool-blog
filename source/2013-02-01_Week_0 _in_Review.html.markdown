>Day 2- Our first day of coding! We learned the basics of Ruby and started working on our Event 
>Manager project which was an adventure in itself. 
>
>Day 3- We worked on our Event Project manager file again and we were broken up between Frank 
>and Jeff. We finished this day with a scavenger hunt in Denver which I am proud to say that my
>team (The Mile High Club) won!
>
>Day 4- Thursday was our first taste of working in groups. We were split up into groups of two 
>to work on our microblogger project. I worked with Raphael and he was very helpful and patient!
>
>Day 5 - Today we were able to hear from the Hungry Academy crew at Living Social. It was 
>interesting to see how they recalled the group dynamics and the projects. We also began our 
>professional blogs and had one-on-ones!
>
>Overall, this week was crazy busy! I can't wait to see what we learn next week!!
