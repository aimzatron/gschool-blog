Now that Traffic Spy is complete, I feel proud of my work on the project. I feel like this is the hardest I have worked on a project yet. I spent pretty much every single day for the past two weeks at Galvanize working on code and style. I think my biggest contribution to this project were the database code (Sequel) and the style of the page. I really enjoyed making the page crazy and fun!

I thought that Sequel was very helpful to learn. There is so much you can do with it and I really appreciate the hyper-organization you can implement with SQL. Sinatra was interesting to learn and use. I really like the way it simplifies otherwise complicated tasks and when you receive an error the message is very specific which always helps. I would love to use both Sinatra and SQL again. I feel like both are logical and reasonably understandable.

If I could go back I would try to contribute more to the testing process and I would have cleaned up the look and feel of my pages. They were fun but they lacked professional structure which is why I am excited to formally learn more about html and css in gSchool. I think trying to understand the relationship between SQLite and Ruby was a bit confusing and we used more languages in this project than any other hands down. I thought the style would be easier than it was. As much as backend work is difficult, there is a huge amount of patience and diligence that goes into editing html and css. It had been a while but I was quickly reminded of this when I started the process.

Strangely, I like databases. I think they are more intuitive because they are so logical. If you want to do something, think of how you want to do it and that is probably close to the way it is written in SQL.

Project Management seems like a waste of time to a lot of people in the class but I think as the projects get larger and more complex, we will have to consider our options for keeping things straight. Also, we will eventually be programming in larger groups and with more people, you need more structure and stability or else things fall apart. 

As far as contributing to open source, I feel like I need to take some time and sit down to try and figure out which open source projects interest me. I have been studying so much, I haven't really had time to explore that avenue. I do think it would be good practice to read other peoples code as well as to try and find ways to improve it. 

I think people are reaching a bit of a burnout point and I can see as time goes by and we get more projects under our belt, people push themselves harder and harder with each one. I think this is a good lesson in having a work-life balance because you can't push yourself too hard otherwise you won't retain any information. The best strategies I have used to de-stress are getting more sleep, making sure to eat 3 meals a day, going on walks and spending time away from the screen which is sadly, easier said than done. One thing I loved about my partner for this project is that she was willing to laugh and have fun during the project. It is important to try and keep a good attitude while you're working because it alleviates some of the emotional stress of performing difficult tasks under the pressure of a deadline.
