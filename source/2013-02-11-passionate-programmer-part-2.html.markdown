I believe the over-arching message of 'The Passionate Programmer' is that we should be aware of the behaviors that will get you places in the development world. Many of the points that were made were how to put yourself out there which is something that I feel many developers have a hard time with. Chad Fowler discussed the fact that many people think that their managers just inherently know what they are doing which is not the case. If you want to be noticed, you have to take charge and find ways to make it happen. 

Another message that was clear to me is to let go of your pride. I think that is another issue that many developers deal with. You think, "I don't want to seem stupid" or "I don't want any one to know that I don't know th answer." Chad shows us that thinking this way will get you nowhere with your career because you aren't learning how to do things the right way and you are wasting time. 

I think as far and what I am looking for in the style and culture of my future employer it would be a place that encourages teaching and training not somehwere where developers horde knowledge. I think good companies know how to get their team to learn everything they can as opposed to having a few good guys they can count on.

Once again, the pride thing comes into play when I think of things that I need to implement. I need to not be afraid to ask questions!
