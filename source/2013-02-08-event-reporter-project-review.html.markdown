>The Event Reporter project was an extension of a project we did previously called Event Manager.>The goal was to implement a program that would allow you to load and search a CSV file and then >translate that into a customized queue that would print out based on the attributes and 
>criteria input.
>
>I feel that this project was important to me because it taught me that sometimes I need to rein >myself in. I made this gigantic outline of all of the requirements for the project that took 
>about an hour to compile. I think that was both a good step and misstep. It is good to find a 
>way to make directions more understandable for yourself but it is destructive if you do not do 
>it correctly. It is not necessarily that I made the outline in the wrong way but more that I 
>didn't put the specific commands required in it. 
>
>So there I went off into coding land with my hand dandy outline that ended up being my only 
>guideline. Then, when it came time for a peer evaluation of my code and the testers were given 
>specific instructions. My program did not meet any of the criteria. The program worked but not 
>in the way it was supposed to.
>
>I realized that if I am going to be a developer, I will need to adhere to client's specific 
>demands. In other words, if they specify that they want a command to be 'puppy' I should not 
>try to be clever and name it 'dog'. This is an integral part of the development world. I feel 
>that I would have done better had I not spent so much time trying to do it my own way.
>
>Peer interaction is also something I learned is very important during the development process 
>because if you are stuck you can ask someone a question. I know that sometimes I let my pride 
>get in the way and I don't ask enough questions. If I had been more open to receiving help, I 
>probably would have noticed my mistakes early on. I also would probably not have had to spend 
>so many hours working on the base of the project because my questions would have been resolved 
>more quickly. It is an incredible resource to have peers that you can rely on and help 
>throughout this process because everyone knows something different. Many developers learn a 
>language without those resources and I know now that I should feel fortunate to have such 
>intelligent and obliging people around me.
>
>Was this my best project? No. I will say right now that this will be the worst I will do on a 
>project in the 6 months of gSchool because I will not make the same mistakes twice. I am 
>actually glad this happened early on because once the programs become more complex, I will need >more than ever to be concious of my process. Now that the cracks in my process have been 
>exposed, it will make it easier to make the necessary changes to improve my performance in 
>later projects.
