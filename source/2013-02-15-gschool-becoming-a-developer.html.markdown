The path to becoming a developer has become a bit clearer over the past week. I feel more grounded than I have before. When you first step into an opportunity like gSchool it is overwhelming and intimidating. You start to wonder, why am I part of the 24 that were chosen for this program? Don't they understand that I don't belong with all these insanely smart people?

I think the realization I came to this week was that gSchool knows that you may feel lost but that is why you are in a school, to learn from teachers who want you to succeed with a bunch other people who are probably feeling just as freaked out as you are. The wonderful thing about this experience is the immense support you have with all of your peers. It's kind of like being stranded on a desert island with a bunch of people you don't know but if you get to know them and properly utilize the resources that are available to you, you can make something awesome out of something that was once terrifying. 

I am excited to see what everyone becomes. Everyone in the room with me has something different that is their strength and it is interesting to watch where they go with it. Everyone has a different path that they are forging but none of them seem to be headed down the wrong one. 

One thing that has become apparent to me is that in order to keep my sanity, I have to let go every once in a while and go do something that has nothing to do with programming. It is really important to create a good balance between your work load and personal time. If you try to do too much you start to shut down and that impedes your retention and comprehension of the material. 

Our current project, Sales Engine has been an awesome learning experience. It is amazing to think that we are already working on an API with only 3 weeks of programming knowledge but that does not negate the fact that it is an incredible challenge. 

I was really struggling with the identity of self in Ruby. To me, the overall idea of scope is conceptually difficult so I asked for clairification from the teachers at gSchool and I feel much more cofident about my understanding of self now. As an added bonus, I learned the term "scopegoat" which made me laugh.

Testing is challenging at first but I think it is rewarding becaus it makes you really take apart how things in your program work which has helped me better grasp what I am doing. It is also a comfort to know that things are always working. Overall, I am now a proponent of test driven development!

Pairing has been a learning experience as well. It is nice to have a second set of eyes looking at all your work and validating you when you do something right and explaining things when you do something incorrectly. 

So far gSchool has been an adventure and I am excited to see what is in store for us in the months to come!!
