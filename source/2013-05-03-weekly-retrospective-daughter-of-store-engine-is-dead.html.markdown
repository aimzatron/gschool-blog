This week has been kind of a blur. Team Ballmer (my team for the DOSE project) worked really hard on our project and I honestly think it paid off. There are a few design changes I would have made but that was sort of an after thought. Most of all, I felt like I made a difference on the team and I felt that if I hadn't been there not as much work would have gotten done. It was awesome to feel like the team appreciated and needed me. 
 
Often it feels like in our groups we there is always someone that wants to do everything and in this project I felt like people were willing to share the workload a bit. I think because there are many people that take on a bit too much responsability, it makes it difficult for others to learn the hardest parts of building a program. I think this is a realization I have come to with this project. You have to stake claim on something from the beginning so that you always have something to work on. Also, staking claim does not mean you have to have a complete game plan before you take it on since a lot of programming is improvisation. Hesitation becomes a crippling weakness. You have to use the tools that you have in your head and the magical tool called Google.

If we had to continue to work on Store Engine for another two weeks, I am sure many of the gschool students would be a bit frustrated. On the other hand, I think it is a good exercise because it is probably closer to what the working experience will be for almost everyone. Maybe that is a misconcpetion on my part but I am going to say that for the most part you probably will be working with someone else's code in the professional world. Overall, I wouldn't freak out if we had to do it again because I feel like I learned more on "Daughter of Store Engine" than I have on past projects. 

I am nervous and excited to work on API's. I think the intangible part about API's is what freaks me out. I know how to shop online, I know what it should look like. I don't however know exactly how an API will always work which is rather intimidating. However, on the last project I took on killing all of the bugs in the code which was a scary thought but I ended up doing it without much help from others. As long as I dive in head first, I think API's will be fun to work with.

I do feel that I have addressed many of my weaknesses with Rails in th past two weeks. This week, I was able to fix many issues that I did not think that I could and I learned many things in the process!

As far as my career aspirations go, I am not sure where I want to end up yet. I feel like programming is cool because you can pretty much work in any field as far as the content of what you are working on goes. I think it would be cool to eventually work somewhere that I had an interest in not only what they were developing but also whatever their company's product is. I thought the talk we got from Erica was amazing because I am interested in what she is working with. I think video integration is really cool and I like things with more of a creative focus. I don't think I will ever be the type to rush to a job in the financial industry or some hardcore analytics gig. I need to be sufficiently interested in or dedicated to the product or cause of a company.

I think the past two weeks have been quite eye-opening. I have been able to tackle problems I didn't think could, accessed knowledge I didn't know I had, work independently and I realized that I am a logical person if I can stay focused and chip away at a problem piece by piece I can do pretty amazing things!
