This week has been crazy! Up until Thursday, I had been pulling a lot of 13 or 14 hour days. I feel like it was time well spent. The team worked hard on our Store Engine project and cranked out what I think was good quality work. 

I learned many valuable things from this project. I feel like I understand the overall structure of MVC framework better. It is one of those things where unless you are working on something and have to go through tons of files over and over again it is hard to visualize what it will look like. Also, I love how much less code it takes to create af feature that sorts through data because of ActiveRecord. I think views are something we all became more familiar with which I think is helpful because it is what links all of your hard work behind-the-scenes to the user visually. Just knowning how to implement things in a more efficient way is so awesome! All of these things will come in handy on future projects.

The cool thing about working in a larger team is that you can create something probably much more polished and much more quickly than you would in a 1 or 2 person team. I also like that everyone has something different that they bring to the table or that they are passionate about. I think there can be more conflict with a larger team because it is easier to just work with the people you want to work with instead of forcing yourself to collaborate. I think our team did a great job of working together.

As far as things I would do differently in the next project, I would say that I would probably try to ask more questions as always. Push myself harder as far as jumping into things that I am less familiar with. I have noticed one of the biggest things that helps me learn is just getting me out of my comfort zone. 

I feel like the team was probably about 75% more productive than a two-person team. I feel like our team was really productive because we had so many different skillsets and we worked well together. In the professional world, when we are working in hand-picked teams with other developers and designers it will be interesting to see what amazing things can happen. 

I definitely refelected on "Don't Make Me Think"
a lot during this project because as much as this project was about learning rails, it was also the first time we have had such an extensive user interface. After readin "Don't Make Me Think", I started seeing counter-intuitive designs everywhere I looked! It was interesting watching others use our app because they do things a completely different way than you think they would, exactly as Steve Krug said they would. It can be frustrating because you want to say "You are supposed to go here!" but you have to realize that not everyone is going to navigate the same way you are.
