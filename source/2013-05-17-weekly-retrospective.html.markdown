Another one bites the dust...

Feed Engine seems to be moving slowly. The amount of API integrations has made the level of complexity rise for this project.
Our group has taken an alternative approach and decided to use hstore and STI instead of multiple tables. I feel that this decision has made the project much more challenging for me but I am working towards having a higher understanding of all of this by the end of the project.

We are going to kick it into high gear for the last six days but I want us to keep the idea of quality in perspective. I don't want it to look shabby when we are done. I just want the features that we can get done to be done well so we will have to be diligent about that!

When I think about completing gSchool, I think that it will be weird to have free time again and awesome to start doing all of these things in the real world.
