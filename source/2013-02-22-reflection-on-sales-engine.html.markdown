Oh, Sales Engine. This project was by far the most challenging project we have done in gSchool. There are a lot of reasons but I think the primary reason it was difficult was due to the extensive data that it involved. 

This was our first large pair project and it was a good intro into how to effectively work in a pair. I felt like there are a lot of things I could have done much better in that respect. Sometimes you learn more when you fall on your face which is kind of what I did but I am better for it. 
I do not think I would go back and change things because I do feel that I learned a lot about the process of communication. 

I put about 50 or 60 hours into this project. Were all of those hours totally 100% productive. Most likely not. I think that I did not pomadoro enough on this project which made it more difficult to clear my head. Part of the time I felt like I was just spinning my wheels and not getting anywhere because I needed to take a moment and breathe.

If I was going to do this project over again, I would as always, ask more questions and spend less time sitting there tryig to figure something out that I cannot understand. I also think I would be more thorough with checking that all tests are passing. We got one set of tests passing and then we would have problems with the other set and in the end we missed a few due to our diligence with one set and not the other. 

It is funny because about 6 months ago I was faced with an issue where I had to merge data using good ol' Microsoft Office and it was much more complicated than it would have been had I already been able to program. Even though this project felt like it took a long time, I feel like I have the ability to use this information to my advantage to make merging data easier on me in the long run which is a priceless skill. 

You have finished your first real project. Are you a developer now?

The answer to that question is summed up in one statement: it's complicated. As much as I feel like I understand more than I did three weeks ago, I am not fully confident that I could go out and just make whatever I wanted to make. I guess I define being a developer as having the freedom to think about something and make it and if I am judging myself on those standards then I would have to say no. 

I am excited to shift to a webcontext. I feel like I have more experience with web context than back end programming so I think it will be cool to formalize my self-taught skills!

My favorite thing about the class is that there is so much built in support and everyone is rooting for you to succeed. No one wants to see you fail. I think when you are in a larger professional or educational arena there are more personal factors involved where some people may have other reasons for being there than bettering your education. I feel like people are actually interested in seeing you be the best you can which is a rare quality in a school.
