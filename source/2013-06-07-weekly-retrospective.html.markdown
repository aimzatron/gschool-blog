Our individual project has been exciting for me because I have been able to see what I can do on my own. I have found that I am able to accomplish a lot more than I thought. 

I will say I probably spent more hours on this project than any other because I didn't have to coordinate with a team and also because I didn't have a team to support me. I still was able to reach out to my peers for help and they were more than willing to do so. 

I think this project was hard for me but it was a good challenge because I felt that I was able to figure things out if I just plugged away. I think limiting distractions during my work time was key to staying on point. I did not have enough time to fully finish my app but I got it to the minimum viable product stage. I knew that based on the size of this project I was not going to be able to finish everything and so I have chosen to continue work on this. 

One thing that was awesome is I discovered how little info there is on mapping with foursquare. I am thinking of making a gem that compares foursquare latitude and longitude with google maps and plots points for you. It is a small thing that could help other people building similar apps. I think combining those two items was difficult so it would be nice to be able to simplify it for someone else.

I gained confidence in my ability on this project because I did the majority of the code on my own. There are some things I could have done better. As always, writing more tests is key. I think based on the time period we had to finish this project, it was hard to keep TDD in our minds but I feel like as much as you think TDD takes more time it actually means you will spend less time trying to debug. 

The app that I had built yesterday definitely made me happy. I feel like I got done what I set out to do. One thing I didn't do was spend enough time checking my heroku deployment. I had deployed the night before to heroku and in hero mode, I just loaded the page and saw that the front page worked and moved onto some other things I was working on but it turned out that the other pages in the app were not loading. Because I did not check this sooner, I tried to fix it in the few hours of class time we had before the presentation. I worked on it with other students and with teachers and we were unable to get it loaded in time. It was really disappointing to not be able to present but I should have been more careful during deployment. 

The next iteration for my project is to get the team scavenger hunt working. That is not as complicated because it doesn't involve mapping. It just involves making hints and setting up a way for people to create their own hunt. I also would like to incorporate background workers for more efficient data transfer with the API and AJAX. I would also like to make it so the user doesn't have to go through so many steps to get somewhere and I would like to refactor some things that I have already done. Finally, if I have time I would like to make this a native mobile app eventually. This app makes more sense on a phone. I would like to challenge myself into working with mobile development. I am not sure on the time frame on this. I think for mastery I just want to get teams implemented, add some animation, ajax, testing and refactoring. The mobile app may be something I will work on later on unless I get enough time.
