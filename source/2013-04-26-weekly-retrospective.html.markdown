I have had a great week this week to say the least. Something has definitely clicked with me. 

When we started daughter of store engine, I think everyone was a bit disheartened by the results of son of store engine but I honestly think this is a better project. We are using an existing multi-tenancy app and adding features unique to each group. I think the fact that each group has unique features makes it easier to keep the group focus instead of answering everyone outside of your groups questions. I felt like the group I am in has really bonded this week because we have to help eachother. I think when we all have the same exact project sometimes people will be asking someone outside of the group for help instead of asking the team first. I don't think this is out of disrespect to the team, it is more of a bad habit. It is good to have to rely on only your group because then everyone in the group is able to contribute something and learn as well.

I decided on this project to focus entirely on bugs. The people in my group seemed rather confused by the notion that I really desired to work on bugs. I honestly think I was hesitant even when I suggested it but once I started I couldn't stop. I felt like I was finally getting my hands dirty, like I finally had people who trusted me enough to get the kinks worked out. 
The nice thing about fixing issues is that you tend to have to go through every facet of the code which is an amazingly helpful experience. I think when people want to learn something we kind of ease ourselves into it, slowly reading and gathering information but that doesn't seem to work for me. Immersing myself in the things no one wanted to touch has made me have much more confidence in my ability as a programmer and it has made me believe I can learn all the things I thought I would struggle with for a while. 

Working with the existing codebase is difficult but I also think it is extremely helpful in getting us to understand the way professional programmers work. How often are we really going to be starting from scratch on a project? Probably not very often. I think it was Jeff who said some people think that it is helpful to just continuously read other people's code and I would say that it helps me a lot just seeing different implementations. Sometimes I feel like there are so many ways to do things in Ruby that I just sort of stop and think, "Is this the best way?" 

What I have learned is that if you just keep typing and let your brain send what logic you have to your keyboard you get much further. I have seen all of the people I consider good programmers do this. They just type and talk themselves through it. No matter what their hands keep typing even if it means having to hit the delete key a few hundred times. Last time I checked, no one got anywhere by sitting around just pondering things. While programming requires a considerable amount of logic, that does not constitute staring at my screen for 30 minutes trying to fully comprehend the readme for a warm-up exercise. I don't learn anything by trying to just sit and think. I learn by doing it over and over and over until it just flows out without much thought at all. 

Working closely with a client is helpful because we can ask more questions and get clearer guidelines. I have also learned that sometimes you have to reign in peoples expectations as far as time constraints and the overall scope of work goes. I learned this to a certain extent in IT when people would want me to transfer a terabyte of data in 20 minute. At some point you have to underpromise and overdeliver. I know it is corporate speak but that thought process seems to come in handy in software development.

I do prefer an agile environment over a waterfall approach. Agile seems to bring the stress level down quite a bit and I feel more comfortable with the results since TDD is encouraged in the agile approach. I think everyone is able to do higher quality work in smaller quantities with agile which I am more comfortable with than quantity over quality.

Working through the bugs in our project has really helped improve my Rails skills. I have learned a lot about Factory Girl as well. I feel like I have been exposed to more testing. It seems like there is always that one person in a group that is obsessed with testing so I really haven't had a chance to do my fair share. I am glad I am improving that skill now.

This week has been awesome and I am ten times more excited about the things we are working on now that I understand them better!
