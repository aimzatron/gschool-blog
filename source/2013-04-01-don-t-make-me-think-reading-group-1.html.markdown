Reading "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Krug has been a rewarding experience so far. He talks about things that we see everyday but don't actually spend to much time analyzing. Once I started reading the book, I started to see all of the styling flaws of various web pages and see the genius of web giants like Amazon.

The book was written quite a while ago, back in the dawn of digital time when we still used dial-up, AOL and MS-DOS. Regardless of the time period, this book is so on point that I don't think that it really matters. Apart from the humorous section where he discusses Windows 95/98, you can't really tell that the book was written so long ago.

I think one thing I rarely thought about until reading this book is how much I do rely on "breadcrumbs" and how they are essential to sites with extensive product lines or pages. They make my life so much easier and it is frustrating when there is no guide to see how you arrived at a certain page.

There hasn't been a point in this book where I have said, "He's totally wrong about that". Most of it is 100% accurate. However, the one part I questioned was where he was discussing what is in the footer of a site and how it is just as important as the top of the site, if not more. I feel like I rarely scroll all the way to the bottom of a page to look for corporate information but maybe other users do and one of Steve's main points is that we shouldn't think about how we would do something but how a user will do something. Those two things often vary greatly. 

Chapter Six, "Street Signs & Breadcrumbs" was one of my favorites so far. I think showing how we use something like street signs every day and that if there is any slight change in them it can throw us off is a good way of explaining the conventions of web design. I really liked that concept.

"Don't Make Me Think" will make me think twice about using weird marketing lingo that others won't understand and confusing navigation menus. I can utilize this in my current project, Store Engine and in really any of my future projects.
