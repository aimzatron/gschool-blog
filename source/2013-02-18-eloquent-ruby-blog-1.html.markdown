'Eloquent Ruby' has been really helpful to me just in the first 9 chapters. I find that the information that is already familiar to me has become even more clear with every chapter I read.

I think all of Chapter 7 "Treat Everything Like An Object" helped me grasp just the general structure of Ruby much better. He talks about how while there is nothing remarkable about the code itself, it is consistency that makes Ruby special. I think just explaining objects in a different way, helped me grasp the entire Object-Oriented Programming concept better.

The content in Chapter 5 was a little intimidating but to be honest, I have already used some regular expressions without having a thorough understanding about what my code was doing. Since I have already applied this to my code in the past, it was nice to learn more about regular expressions and tie it back to my previous experience with them. 

It is interesting because this book has made it clear to me that as a programmer you can think that you know something and then get a whole new take on it and unlock capabilities you were previously unaware of. Just based on what I have already learned, I can tell this book is going to be quite helpful to me in the long run.
