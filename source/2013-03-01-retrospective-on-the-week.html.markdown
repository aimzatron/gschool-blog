I am continually more excited as time goes by in gSchool. It is a wonderful feeling when you know you are grasping the material better than you were before. I think by far the best part of this whole program has been meeting all of the amazing people I go school with. 

When this began, I wasn't sure if I would come out of gSchool with friends but I have come to realize there is no way that will happen. Everyone here has bonded so much just in the first few weeks. Even though we get stressed out and sometimes don't get along, it seems that at the end of the day everyone is willing to help eachother and push eachother to do the best job they can. I am so happy for that support and I am sure it means the world to the students who moved to Colorado not knowing a soul. Over the next five months, I can only imagine us growing closer.

I am nervous about the skills evaluation as I am sure everyone is. I feel my strength will be in testing as I think that I have done pretty well with that on the projects I have done so far. I think my weakness will be thinking on the fly as far as just being able to come up with quick programming solutions because I do not feel like I am fully there yet.

My resolution for next month is to study more and to as always, ask more questions. I want to grasp the material no matter what it takes. That is the most important thing to me while being here. 

As far as our new project Traffic Spy goes, I think that I feel more excited about it because I feel like things are making more sense to me. Also, I am more familiar with the web context than the command-line applications. I feel like going into it I felt like I was more prepared for this project than the projects in the past.

The challenges I have faced with Traffic Spy so far has been understanding the correlation between all the different types of code we are writing. We are covering a lot of new things at once which is exciting but also a bit of a challenge. 

I feel like the project was overwhelming to look at on paper but when you actually take it apart it is not as complicated as it seems. I almost think that the fear that we had about it was good because it helped us learn that we don't know everything yet and that we need to make sure we are taking things one step at a time. 

There aren't too many things that I feel like are slowing me down. The tests are challenging for Traffic Spy because they are a bit more complex. I do feel that Postgres was unecessarily complicated as far as getting it installed and pointing the computer to the new installation instead of the pre-installed version that came with OSX. It was easy to fix but it took a long time to figure out HOW to fix it.

Asking if testing is easier or harder now is a difficult question to answer. Mainly because it is easier to test as you go because you won't have as much work later but I think it is hard to write tests because things are so complex. Sometimes I write a test and think that it is testing some feature when really it is testing something more generic. It is just something that I have to keep pushing myself to learn.
