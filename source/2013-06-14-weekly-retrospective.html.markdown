 This week has gone by really fast. It feels good to be back in a group but sometimes the decision making process is s a bit slower. The nice thing about working by yourself is that you can manage to carve out time whenever you find it available. Which means I can choose to wake up at 2 am and work on things if I want to. With a group you have to ask permission and make sure that everything is okayed by the everyone else. This can be good because it means that your ideas are kept in check and you don't come up with random hairbrained scheme in the middle of the night that make no sense for your project. 

 When I was working on my own, I learned a lot of things that I didn't have extensive knowledge about before. Sometimes in group projects people tend to take parts of the program and not share that part to the rest of the group. I think everyone has a gap somewhere. For me, this was background workers. I had to work on that alone for the first time so I feel more comfortable with them now. 

 The concept of services makes sense to me. It honestly seems like it is more efficient than the way we have made programs before. I would definitely like to delve deeper into it. 

 Our group decided to experiment with Faye for web sockets and we implemented it successfully in a throw away app. Now we are trying to style it and add the features to the chat that we need for our particular end goal. 

 Job hunting is crazy!! It has been really cool so far. I don't think what is intimidating about it is the idea that I won't get a job, it is more that there are so many Ruby jobs it is hard to figure out which ones will be a good fit for you. I have decided to apply to jobs that seem to interest me as well as enquire about jobs at places that do not list postings. I have been seeking help in the DevChix forum and from my mentor to try and find ways to get a job where my employer will foster my growth. Many people have told me that sometimes if someone doesnt have an apprenticeship program all you have to do is ask if it is something they would be interested in doing.

 I have found that all the things that I once knew about job hunting appear to be wrong. I am used to the corporate interview where to put on the nicest clothes you own and try to make yourself look as good as possible. Developers are more down to earth and they want to see what you are actually like. It is nice to be able to strip away all the sugar-coating and just be yourself. 

 It kind of reminds me of a relationship. If you start dating someone by embellishing certain traits or dressing up everytime you go out, that is not a good representation of who you are. Your relationship will be based on this person that is put together all of the time. In that type of situation, if someone really likes you, they really are falling in love with this fake ideal that you can never live up to. You are not your best self 100% of the time so stop trying to pretend you are. If you don't like wearing a suit, don't. If you hate corporate lingo, don't buy into it. I think that mentality is really interesting and so unique to programming.
