A week of review seems to be just what the doctor ordered. I am glad we had time to go over what we have learned so far in depth. Gschool is pretty short so I think it is important to make sure we are grasping things even at such a quick pace.

I think I have learned more this week than I have the whole time only because it cemented all the information in my mind. It is good to have that reinforcement of all of the things I have already learned.

I think all of this has helped me see what my strength and weaknesses are and prepared me to learn on the job. As much as the pace can be intimidating sometimes, I am glad that we are working quickly because it mirrors what our real-life experiences will be on the job. It is good to feel the pressure of a deadline in order to motivate you to do well.  

We have worked really hard and I think it has been a bit intense at times. We have kind of reached a point where we are starting to wear down and I think this time period will be a difficult one to get through. It will really show our strength when we survive March and start to dig in deeper in April. 

There isn't a day that I have regretted my decision to come to gschool because regardless of the workload, financial commitments and lack of a job for six months, I know it will be worth it.
