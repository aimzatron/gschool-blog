I honestly don't even remember half of this week because I feel like I have been so overloaded with work to be done. I have to say I was very challenged by this past project. Not only was it more complex it was just weird because we were essentially all working in the same parts of the code so pretty much everytime you merged anything into master there were tons of merge conflicts. Also, the use of hstore and STI was a first for me so there was another level of complexity added with the decision by our team to use that method. 

The final product was better than I could have imagined and I think this was the first project we have done where I felt like the product we made was worth showing professional developers. I think that Streamrolled definitely reflected our work and time because everyone put in tons of hours on this one and it really paid off. 

I was really impressed with the API's we worked with. Last.fm in particular had so many facets and so many different types of data you could utilize. I think without it our page wouldn't have looked half as good. Overall, I think my opinion on API's is that they are amazing when you need a certain type of data but you will have to find ways to test them and you cannot forget that during implementation. Our team could have been better about trying to use TDD with the APIs but because it was so difficult, I think we shyed away from testing them as thoroughly as they should have been tested. 

As far as the independent project goes, I have an idea that I think will be amazing to pull off. In it's most basic form it is a photo uploader with users and a voting system. It will involve people creating their own version of a stock photo that is diametric to the original. I will most likely use Instagram and maybe Twitter. The API will allow users to upload photos from external sources and link to photos from the site. I think using background workers will be hard for me since I haven't coded them on my own before. I will be asking some of the other gschoolers for help on that one. I am excited to do some independent work because sometimes I have a hard time gauging what I am capable of when I am working in a large group.

The past few weeks have been insanely busy and I see a lot of people getting a bit stir crazy and I think we are all looking forward to the short break we will be getting this weekend. I will be working on my project this weekend but I won't be starting the hardcore work until next week just because I feel like I need a little unwinding. It seems like this whole experience has flown by so fast. I can't believe that we are less than two months away from finishing and becoming professional developers!
