Being exposed to many companies throughout the course of gSchool has been really helpful in my decision on where to apply. It has helped me decide who I want to work with and where I would like to work. I think just making sure I am in a learning environment is the biggest thing that is important to me. There are a few places that I have been exposed to that I feel that I would fit really well in. I would like to work in a consultancy to start because I feel that I woud learn more using multiple types of technology. It is difficult to learn a diversity of concepts if you are working on one project.

I would like to work on trying to learn Javascript better. It seems that no matter what type of company it is they always need a Javascript developer so I think it is a good thing to master. I am also really interested in using some technology to make my Ruby programs into iOS apps/Android apps. I think that would be helpful. The project I am doing for mastery is pretty much going to be used entirely on phone so it seems like a good way to learn. Obviously, I don't think I am going to master these things in the weeks remaining. Especially, with the job hunt going on. This whole process has been uncharted territory for me so it is a bit intense and my focus has shifted a bit. 

I did a technical interview last week that made me realize that I need to be better about how I articulate what certain things do. I think one thing that I have noticed is because I don't have a 4 year formal education in Computer Science sometimes I may not sounds like I know what I am doing because I don't use formal terminology. Many of the CTO's and others that are trying to hire us use multiple languages and have computer science backgrounds. When they ask me questions I feel like sometimes they are things that encompass many languages so they are looking for a broader perspective than I can sometimes provide. I just need to work on my technical vocabulary and make it a point to think before I speak.

I think in the last few weeks everyone needs a bit of flexibility and space to get things done. We are all a bit burnt out so giving us difficult challenges now is going to make it hard for us to represent ourselves well when we are tired and worn out during interviews. I would however like to start some basic Javascript and continue to build on our existing knowledge of js.
